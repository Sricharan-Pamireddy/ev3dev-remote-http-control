Why This Repo Exists:
    This is a node.js class that is meant to be used between a Raspberry Pi and a Lego Mindstorms EV3 running Ev3dev as its operating system.
    I made this project because of some niche requirements and it's not really useful/meant for any other use.

    I wanted to control an Ev3 over the internet along with some video streaming from a mounted camera,
    but a Lego Mindstorms Ev3 does not have capable enough hardware or software support.
    So I have delegated the majority of the networking and thinking to be done by a Raspberry pi 3B+

    Since the Raspberry Pi will have to do the "thinking", I made this class as a way to communicate with the Ev3 from the Pi.
